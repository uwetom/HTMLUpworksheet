This guide will show you how to use an HTML5 UP template to create a website, the HTML 5 symbol will be used when we are writing code.

You will also learn how to save your project and all the changes you make to GitHub. The Octocat symbol will be used when we are interacting with our repository.

## Things to set up

1. Get your favorite text editor out.
   - We recommend **Visual Studio Code** or **Sublime Text**
2. Open a web browser
   - We recommend **Google Chrome**



### Things to remember

- Refresh you browser often to check what your website looks like

- Use **developer tools** to inspect the code

  

#### Get comfy. Lets begin

---

## 1. Create a new repository
![octocat](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\octocat.png)

Open **GitHub desktop** and Sign in (create an account if you haven’t got one already).

Choose **Create a New Repository on your hard drive**

Set the name to be "**Spectral-Alpacas**" and the description to "**HTML5 Alpaca website**"

Choose a suitable location on your hard drive and click **Create repository**.

#### You have Just Created a new local repository!

## 2. Open the repository folder
![octocat](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\octocat.png)

At the bottom right of the screen Click **Show in Finder** (**show in Explorer** on a PC), this will take you to where the repository is stored on your computer. 

![](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\show.jpg)

You should see a folder called **Spectral-Alpacas,** this is where you will put your all the code and assets for this worksheet.

---

##  3. Download the Spectral template from HTML5 UP

![](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\html5.png)

Go to https://html5up.net/

Scroll down to Spectral and click “**Free Download**” 

![](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\spectral.jpg)

*You can use another template for your coursework, but for this worksheet we will be using Spectral*

**Unzip or Extract** this zip file, and put the contents **inside** the **Spectral-Alpacas** folder you found in step 2. 

You should now have a folder called **Spectral-Alpacas** which contains the following files:

![](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\folder.jpg)

## 4. Commit the code to your local repository
![octocat](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\octocat.png)

On **GitHub desktop** you should now see a list of all the files you have added.

On the left you will see the files.

On the right you will see what has changed in each of those files.



![](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\initial_commit.jpg)



Write "**initial commit**" in the summary field and press **Commit to master.**



#### You have now committed your code to your **local repository**!

---

## 5. Publish your repository
![octocat](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\octocat.png)

Press **Publish Repository**

![](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\publish.jpg)

This will upload your files to your account on GitHub.com

#### You have now published your code to your remote repository on GitHub!



---

## 6. View your repository on GitHub
![octocat](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\octocat.png)

Click on **View on GitHub**

![](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\view.jpg)

This will open a browser window and show you your repository on Github.com

Now that it is on the remote repository your work is safe, even if you lose your computer you can just clone a new copy of your work from this repository.

You can also share your code with others and see exactly what changes have been made.

Throughout the rest of this worksheet we will be making changes to our files on our machines, committing those changes to the **local repository** and then pushing to the **remote repository**. This way we make sure our remote repository is kept up to date.

## 7. Edit the title
![](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\html5.png)

Phew, now that we have setup GitHub we can now start editing the code.

Open **index.html** on your web browser.

![](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\specral_screenshot.jpg)



Open **index.html** on your text editor

In the index.html file, you will see the `<title></title>` tag. This changes the text in the tab title of your website.

Change the tile from:

`<title>Spectral by HTML5 UP</title> `

to:

**`<title>ALPACAS FOREVAH</title> `**

**Save**

**Refresh your browser to see the change**

## 8. Commit changes
![octocat](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\octocat.png)

Now look at GitHub desktop, it will show you what you have changed.

This is only a small change but we will add it to our repository

Change the summary message from:

`Update index.html!`

to:

**`Updated title`**

Press Commit to Master to add this change to your local repository

![](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\commit.jpg)

We will wait to push to the remote repository until we have a few more changes.

## 9. Change the main heading
![](C:\Users\t-garne\OneDrive - UWE Bristol (Staff)\Creative-technology\digital_media\web_design\2020-2021\github_html5_up\github\HTMLUpworksheet\html5.png)



The main heading of a page is in the heading tag

`<header id="header" class="alt"> `

In this case it is hidden until the user scrolls the page.

In index.html, change the heading text from:

`<h1><a href="index.html">Spectral</a></h1>`

to:

`<h1><a href="index.html">Lamas Are Cool</a></h1> `

Save

Refresh your browser and find what has changed (HINT: you may need to scroll)

We are going to make a few text changes to the main menu.

`<div id="menu">`

Look at the menu in your browser before you make the changes.

Then find it in the code and see how it is structured. <li > is a list item,
